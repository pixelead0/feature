## Supabase Functionality Used
To build Feature.so, I've made use of Supabase for their lightning quick Postgres database, as well as implementing magic links and Twitter auth.

## The Build Process / My Thoughts
This initial MVP took me 4 nights to build, and simply wouldn't have been possible without Supabase's easy to understand docs, auth process, and welcoming community. Having the community support whilst building Feature.so was amazing.
